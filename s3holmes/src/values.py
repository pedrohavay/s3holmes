Welcome, user!

The S3Holmes is designed to easiest explore the S3 buckets. There are two main screens this project, which are the configuration and file explorer screens.

The configuration screen has some fields that can be quickly configured. The following:

[Target]: The target should be an S3 Bucket. You can pass either URL or only name.

[Use AWS Keys]: The select allows you to use or not the AWS Keys to access the bucket.
